FAQ Summary
============

Shinken users, developers, administrators possess a body of knowledge that usually provides a quick path to problem resolutions. The Frequently Asked Questions questions are compiled from user questions and issues developers may run into.

Have you consulted at all the :ref:`resources available for users and developers <contributing/index>`.

**__Before posting a question to the forum:__**

  * Read the through the  :ref:`Getting Started tutorials <gettingstarted/index>`

General Shinken troubleshooting steps to resolve common issue
---------------------------------------------------------------

  * Have you mixed installation methods! :ref:`Cleanup and install using a single method <gettingstarted/installations/shinken-installation>`.

  * Have you reviewed your :ref:`Shinken daemon specific logs <troubleshooting/troubleshooting-shinken#FAQ-1>` for errors or tracebacks (what the system was doing just before a crash)
  * Have you reviewed your :ref:`configuration syntax <configuration/config>` (keywords and values)
  * Is what you are trying to use installed? Are its dependencies installed! Does it even work.
  * Is what you are trying to use :ref:`a supported version <gettingstarted/installations/shinken-installation#requirements>`?
  * Are you using the same Python Pyro module version on all your hosts running a Shinken daemon (You have to!)
  * Are you using the same Python version on all your hosts running a Shinken daemon (You have to!)
  * Have you installed Shinken with the SAME prefix (ex: /usr/local) on all your hosts running a Shinken daemon (You have to!)
  * Have you enabled debugging logs on your daemon(s)
  * How to identify the source of a Pyro MemoryError
  * Problem with Livestatus, did it start, is it listening on the expected TCP port, have you enabled and configured the module in /etc/shinken/modules/livestatus.cfg.
  * Have you installed the check scripts as the shinken user and not as root
  * Have you executed/tested your command as the shinken user

  * Can you connect to your remote agent NRPE, NSClient++, etc. 
  * Have you defined a module on the wrong daemon (ex. NSCA receiver module on a Broker)
  * Have you created a diagram illustrating your templates and inheritance
  * System logs (/var/messages, windows event log)
  * Application logs (MongoDB, SQLite, Apache, etc)
  * Security logs (Filters, Firewalls operational logs)
  * Use top or Microsoft Task manager or process monitor (Microsoft sysinternals tools) to look for memory, cpu and process issues.
  * Use nagiostat to check latency and other core related metrics.
  * Is your check command timeout too long
  * Have you looked at your Graphite Carbon metrics
  * Can you connect to the Graphite web interface
  * Are there gaps in your data
  * Have you configured your storage schema (retention interval and aggregation rules) for Graphite collected data.
  * Are you sending data more often than what is expected by your storage schema.

FAQ Answers
===========

.. _troubleshooting/troubleshooting-shinken#FAQ-1:

Review the daemon logs
----------------------

A daemon is a Shinken process. Each daemon generates a log file by default. If you need to learn more about what is what, go back to :ref:`the shinken architecture <architecture/the-shinken-architecture>`.
The configuration of a daemon is set in the .ini configuration file(ex. brokerd.ini).
Logging is enabled and set to level INFO by default.

Default log file location ''local_log=%(workdir)s/schedulerd.log''

The log file will contain information on the Shinken process and any problems the daemon encounters.


.. _troubleshooting/troubleshooting-shinken#FAQ-2:

Changing the log level during runtime
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

shinken-admin is a command line script that can change the logging level of a running daemon.

''linux-server# ./shinken-admin ...''


.. _troubleshooting/troubleshooting-shinken#FAQ-3:

Changing the log level in the configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Edit the <daemon-name>.ini file, where daemon name is pollerd, schedulerd, arbiterd, reactionnerd, receiverd.
Set the log level to: DEBUG 
Possible values: DEBUG,INFO,WARNING,ERROR,CRITICAL

Re-start the Shinken process.


.. _troubleshooting/troubleshooting-shinken#FAQ-4:

OSError read-only filesystem error
----------------------------------

You poller daemon and reactionner daemons are not starting and you get a traceback for an OSError in your logs.

''OSError [30] read-only filesystem''

Execute a 'mount' and verify if /tmp or /tmpfs is set to 'ro' (Read-only).
As root modify your /etc/fstab to set the filesystem to read-write.


.. _troubleshooting/troubleshooting-shinken#FAQ-5:

OSError too many files open
---------------------------

The operating system cannot open anymore files and generates an error. Shinken opens a lot of files during runtime, this is normal. Increase the limits.

Google: changing the max number of open files linux / debian / centos / RHEL

cat /proc/sys/fs/file-max

# su - shinken
$ ulimit -Hn
$ ulimit -Sn

This typically changing a system wide file limit and potentially user specific file limits. (ulimit, limits.conf, sysctl, sysctl.conf, cat /proc/sys/fs/file-max)

# To immediately apply changes
ulimit -n xxxxx now


.. _troubleshooting/troubleshooting-shinken#FAQ-6:

Notification emails have generic-host instead of host_name
----------------------------------------------------------

Try defining host_alias, which is often the field used by the notification methods.

Why does Shinken use both host_alias and host_name. Flexibility and historicaly as Nagios did it this way.
